# MVC-CRUD-with-bootstrap-in-php
- A functional CRUD using MVC model, basically an administrative part of a fictional online store. This was made for a course task (ETEC).

- Resources used: PHP, SQL, phpMyAdmin, Bootstrap.

The "loja_daniel" paste contains the project without a login function, and no bootstrap.
The "lojaboots_daniel" paste contains the full project :D

In case you wanna test it out with XAMPP, just remember to upload the database(.sql) to phpMyAdmin. Here's the login and password: alunos@gmail.com / admin
